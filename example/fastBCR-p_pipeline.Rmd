### 1. Fast BCR clonal family inference
## 1.1. Data loading
# load paired dataset from PAIRED_folder_path
PAIRED_folder_path <- "example/example_paired"
```

```{r}
## 1.2. Data preprocessing
# Preprocessing of raw data to meet the input requirements for clonal family inference.
# the sample datasets are csv files
raw_sample_list <- data.load(folder_path = PAIRED_folder_path,
                             storage_format = "csv")
# preprocess datasets and check required columns
paired_sample_list <- paired.preprocess(raw_sample_list)
```

```{r}
## 1.3. BCR clonal family inference with paired chain
# Fast clonal family inference from paired.preprocess data.
# The "cluster_thre" parameter represents minimal clustering criteria (minimum number of sequences needed to form a cluster) and defaults to 3.
# For high efficiency, the "cluster_thre" is increased by 1 for every 100,000 entries of input data.
# The "overlap_thre" parameter represents overlap coefficient threshold for merging two clusters, selectable range (0,1) and defaults to 0.1.
# Lower "overlap_thre" may lead to overclustering while higher thresholds may lead to the split of clonal families.
# The "consensus_thre" parameter represents the consensus score threshold for filtering candidates and defaults to 0.8.
# A higher "consensus_thre" means stricter inference of the cluster.
# Set 'paired = TRUE' to use fastBCR-p to infer clonal families from paired BCR sample list. While, defult parameter is "paired = FASLE", meant to inference only by heavy chain.)
cluster_lists <- data.BCR.clusters(paired_sample_list, cluster_thre = 3,
                                   overlap_thre = 0.1, consensus_thre =0.8, 
                                   paired = TRUE)

### 2.Public Classification Analysis
## 2.1. Install `reticulate` for R-Python integration:
install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```
```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 14}
## 2.2. Create and activate the Python environment with the necessary dependencies:
# ```bash
# conda create --name r-py-env python=3.9
# conda activate r-py-env
# ```
## 2.3. Install bcr_v_bert and pubbcrpredictor manually according to the README.md
```

```{r}
## 2.4.	Load the fastBCR library and sample data:
# Load sample data (provided in the 'example_paired' folder)
data_heavy <- read.csv("example/example_public/public_heavy_antibody.csv")
data_light <- read.csv("example/example_public/public_light_antibody.csv")
## 2.5 Load reticulate for R-Python integration and activate the Python environment with BCR_V_BERT and PubBCRPredictor packages
# Activate the Python environment in R, and "r-py-env" need to be changed to your Python environment.
use_condaenv("r-py-env", required = TRUE)

## 2.6 Run public antibody prediction:
# The "model" parameter is the prediction model you want to use.
# There are 4 models as follows:

# Predict public heavy chain antibodies (all CDRs)
heavy_chain_results <- predict_public_antibody(data_heavy, model = "cdrh", python_env = "r-py-env")

# Predict public light chain antibodies (all CDRs)
light_chain_results <- predict_public_antibody(data_light, model = "cdrl", python_env = "r-py-env")

# Predict public heavy chain antibodies (CDR3)
heavy_chain_results_cdr3 <- predict_public_antibody(data_heavy, model = "cdrh3", python_env = "r-py-env")

# Predict public light chain antibodies (CDR3)
light_chain_results_cdr3 <- predict_public_antibody(data_light, model = "cdrl3", python_env = "r-py-env")
```

```{r}
## 2.7 Filter and separate high and low public antibodies:
# Apply the filter to the prediction results
filtered_results <- filter_public_antibodies(heavy_chain_results, threshold = 0.5)

print(filtered_results$high_public)  # High public antibodies
print(filtered_results$low_public)  # Low public antibodies
```
