\title{Function: Preprocessing of raw data to meet the input requirements for clonal family inference}
\usage{
data.preprocess(
  raw_data_list,
  productive_only = FALSE,
  count_col_name = NA,
  count_filter_thre = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_data_list}{A list where each element is the raw data named after its filename}

\item{productive_only}{Whether to filter out unproductive sequences based on the "productive" information in the raw data.
Defaults to "FALSE".}

\item{count_col_name}{The column name for the count of each sequence.
Defaults to "NA" which means the original count of the sequence is not taken into account.}

\item{count_filter_thre}{The threshold of "clone_count" under which the clonotype sequence will be filtered.
Defaults to "NA" which means no clonotype sequence should be filtered.}
}
\value{
A list where each element is the processed data named after its filename
