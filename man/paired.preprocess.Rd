\title{Function: Preprocess datasets and check required columns of paired data}
\usage{
paired.preprocess(
  paired_raw_data_list,
  productive_only = FALSE,
  count_col_name = NA,
  count_filter_thre = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{paired_raw_data_list}{A list of paired data.}
}
\value{
Processed data as input for clonal family inference
}
\description{
To infer clonal families successfully, the dataset should include essential columns:
1. v_call_heavy: heavy chain V gene with or without allele,
2. j_call_heavy: heavy chain J gene with or without allele,
3. junction_aa_heavy: amino acid translation of the heavy chain junction,
4. v_call_light: light chain V gene with or without allele,
5. j_call_light: light chain J gene with or without allele,
6. junction_aa_light: amino acid translation of the light chain junction
